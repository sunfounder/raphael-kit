Schematic Diagram
-----------------

In this experiment, a passive buzzer, a PNP transistor and a 1k resistor
are used between the base of the transistor and GPIO to protect the
transistor.

When GPIO17 is given different frequencies, the passive buzzer will emit
different sounds; in this way, the buzzer plays music.

The code run, the buzzer plays a piece of music.

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    CL = [0, 131, 147, 165, 175, 196, 211, 248]     # Frequency of Bass tone in C major
    CM = [0, 262, 294, 330, 350, 393, 441, 495]     # Frequency of Midrange tone in C major
    CH = [0, 525, 589, 661, 700, 786, 882, 990]     # Frequency of Treble tone in C major     

These are the frequencies of each note. The first 0 is to 
skip CL[0] so that the number 1-7 corresponds to the CDEFGAB of the tone.

.. code-block:: python

    song_1 = [  CM[3], CM[5], CM[6], CM[3], CM[2], CM[3], CM[5], CM[6], 
                CH[1], CM[6], CM[5], CM[1], CM[3], CM[2], CM[2], CM[3],
                CM[5], CM[2], CM[3], CM[3], CL[6], CL[6], CL[6], CM[1],
                CM[2], CM[3], CM[2], CL[7], CL[6], CM[1], CL[5] ]

These arrays are the notes of a song.

.. code-block:: python

    beat_1 = [  1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1,
                1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1,
                1, 1, 3 ]

Every sound beat (each number) represents the ⅛ beat, or 0.5s

.. code-block:: python

    Buzz = GPIO.PWM(Buzzer, 440)
    Buzz.start(50)  

Define pin Buzzer as PWM pin, then set its frequency to 440 and 
Buzz.start(50) is used to run PWM. What’s more, set the duty cycle to 50%.

.. code-block:: python

    for i in range(1, len(song_1)): 
                Buzz.ChangeFrequency(song_1[i]) 
                time.sleep(beat_1[i] * 0.5)  

Run a for loop, then the buzzer will play the notes in the array song_1[] 
with the beats in the beat_1[] array, .

Now you can hear the passive buzzer playing music.
