3.1.1 Photograph Module
==========================

Introduction
-----------------

In this kit, equipped with a camera module, let's try to take a picture with Raspberry Pi.

For more information on how to connect the camera module and its configuration, please refer to :ref:`Camera Module`.

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:** Go into the Raspberry Pi Desktop. You may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Or access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`Remote Desktop`.


**Step 2:** Open a Terminal and get into the folder of the code.

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/raphael-kit/nodejs/

**Step 3:** Run the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo node camera.js

After the code runs, the camera will take a photo. Now you can see the photo named ``test.jpg`` in current directory. 



**Code**

.. code-block:: js

    const exec = require('child_process').exec;

    exec('libcamera-still -o test.jpg');

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: js

    const exec = require('child_process').exec;

Import the ``child_process`` module, which allows nodejs to perform various operations on child processes, including creating child processes to directly execute system commands.

.. note:: 
    About this module, please refer to: https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html

.. code-block:: js

    exec('libcamera-still -o test.jpg');

After enabling the Camera function, you can directly use the command ``libcamera-still -o test.jpg`` to capture photos in the terminal. We can also use the method provided by the ``child_process`` module ``child_process.exec(cmd, [options] , callback)`` to create child processes to run system commands.

By adding loop and delay functions, we can also achieve the effect of timing photos or time-lapse video.
