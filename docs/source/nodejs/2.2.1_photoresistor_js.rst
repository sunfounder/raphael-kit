   Depending on your kit version, please identify whether you have **ADC0834** or **MCP3008** and proceed with the matching section.

Introduction
------------

Photoresistor is a commonly used component of ambient light intensity in
life. It helps the controller to recognize day and night and realize
light control functions such as night lamp. This project is very similar
to potentiometer, and you might think it changing the voltage to sensing
light.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../img/image198.png

**Step 2:** Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd ~/raphael-kit/nodejs/

**Step 3:** Run the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    sudo node photoresistor.js

When the code is running, 
the brightness of the LED will change according to the light intensity sensed by the photoresistor.

**Code**

.. code-block:: js

    const Gpio = require('pigpio').Gpio;
    const ADC0834 = require('./adc0834.js').ADC0834;

    exports.ADC0834 = ADC0834;

    const adc = new ADC0834(17, 18, 27);

    const led = new Gpio(22, {mode: Gpio.OUTPUT});

    setInterval(() => {
      adc.read(0).then((value) => {
        console.log(value);
        led.pwmWrite(value);
      }, (error)=>{
        console.log("Error: " + error);
      });
    }, 100);



**Code Explanation**

The codes here are the same as that in 2.1.7 Potentiometer. 
Please check the code explanation of :ref:`2.1.7_js` for details.
