3.1.3 Audio Module
=====================

Introduction
-----------------

In this project, let's make a DIY stereo with an audio power amplifier module, 8ohm/2w speakers and a 3.5mm Audio cable.

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

After building the circuit according to the above diagram, then plug the audio cable into the Raspberry Pi’s 3.5mm audio jack.

**Step 2:** Get into the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/raphael-kit/python/

**Step 3:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    python3 3.1.3_AudioModule.py

After the code runs, you can enjoy the music.

.. note::

    If your speaker have no sound, it may be because the Raspberry Pi has selected the wrong audio output (The default is HDMI), you need to :ref:`Change Audio Output` to Headphones.

    If you feel that the volume of the speakers is too low, you can :ref:`Adjust Volume`.

**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit\python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

    from pygame import mixer

    mixer.init()
    
    def main():
        mixer.music.load('/home/pi/raphael-kit/music/my_music.mp3')
        mixer.music.set_volume(0.7)
        mixer.music.play()
        while True:
            pass# Don't do anything.
    
    def destroy():
        mixer.music.stop()
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        try:
            main()
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            destroy()

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    from pygame import mixer

    mixer.init()

Import the ``mixer`` method in the ``pygame`` library and initialize the method.

.. code-block:: python

    mixer.music.load('/home/pi/raphael-kit/music/my_music.mp3')
    mixer.music.set_volume(0.7)
    mixer.music.play()


This code reads the ``my_music.mp3`` file in the ``/home/pi/raphael-kit/music`` directory and sets the volume to 0.7(The range is 0~1). 
The Raspberry Pi will start playing audio When ``mixer.music.play()`` is called.

.. note::
    
    You can also upload other music files to your Raspberry Pi. For a detailed tutorial, please refer to: :ref:`Filezilla Software`.

.. code-block:: python

    mixer.music.stop()

Calling ``mixer.music.stop()`` will stop playing audio.
In addition, you can also pause with ``mixer.music.pause()`` and continue with ``mixer.music.unpause()``.
