2.2.8 Ultrasonic Sensor Module
====================================

Introduction
--------------

The ultrasonic sensor uses ultrasonic to accurately detect objects and
measure distances. It sends out ultrasonic waves and converts them into
electronic signals.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../img/image220.png

**Step 2:** Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/c/2.2.8/

**Step 3:** Compile the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    gcc 2.2.8_Ultrasonic.c -lwiringPi

**Step 4:** Run the executable file.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo ./a.out

With the code run, the ultrasonic sensor module detects the distance
between the obstacle ahead and the module itself, then the distance
value will be printed on the screen.

.. note::

    If it does not work after running, or there is an error prompt: \"wiringPi.h: No such file or directory\", please refer to :ref:`install_wiringpi`.

**Code**

.. code-block:: c

    #include <wiringPi.h>
    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <sys/time.h>

    #define Trig    4
    #define Echo    5

    void ultraInit(void)
    {
        pinMode(Echo, INPUT);
        pinMode(Trig, OUTPUT);
    }

    float disMeasure(void)
    {
        struct timeval tv1;
        struct timeval tv2;
        long time1, time2;
    float dis;

        digitalWrite(Trig, LOW);
        delayMicroseconds(2);

        digitalWrite(Trig, HIGH);
        delayMicroseconds(10);      
        digitalWrite(Trig, LOW);
                                    
        while(!(digitalRead(Echo) == 1));   
        gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);           

        while(!(digitalRead(Echo) == 0));   
        gettimeofday(&tv2, NULL);           

        time1 = tv1.tv_sec * 1000000 + tv1.tv_usec;   
        time2  = tv2.tv_sec * 1000000 + tv2.tv_usec;

        dis = (float)(time2 - time1) / 1000000 * 34000 / 2;  

        return dis;
    }

    int main(void)
    {
        float dis;
        if(wiringPiSetup() == -1){ //when initialize wiring failed,print message to screen
            printf("setup wiringPi failed !");
            return 1;
        }

        ultraInit();
        
        while(1){
            dis = disMeasure();
            printf("%0.2f cm\n\n",dis);
            delay(300);
        }

        return 0;
    }

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: c

    void ultraInit(void)
    {
        pinMode(Echo, INPUT);
        pinMode(Trig, OUTPUT);
    }

Initialize the ultrasonic pin; meanwhile, set Echo to input, Trig to
output.

.. code-block:: c

    float disMeasure(void){};

This function is used to realize the function of ultrasonic sensor by
calculating the return detection distance.

.. code-block:: c

    struct timeval tv1;
    struct timeval tv2;

Struct timeval is a structure used to store the current time. The
complete structure is as follows:

.. code-block:: c

    struct timeval
    {
    __time_t tv_sec;        /* Seconds. */
    __suseconds_t tv_usec;  /* Microseconds. */
    };

Here, tv_sec represents the seconds that Epoch spent when creating
struct timeval. Tv_usec stands for microseconds or a fraction of
seconds.

.. code-block:: c

    digitalWrite(Trig, HIGH);
    delayMicroseconds(10);     
    digitalWrite(Trig, LOW);

A 10us ultrasonic pulse is being sent out.

.. code-block:: c

    while(!(digitalRead(Echo) == 1));
    gettimeofday(&tv1, NULL);

This empty loop is used to ensure that when the trigger signal is sent,
there is no interfering echo signal and then get the current time.

.. code-block:: c

    while(!(digitalRead(Echo) == 0)); 
    gettimeofday(&tv2, NULL);

This empty loop is used to ensure that the next step is not performed
until the echo signal is received and then get the current time.

.. code-block:: c

    time1 = tv1.tv_sec * 1000000 + tv1.tv_usec;
    time2  = tv2.tv_sec * 1000000 + tv2.tv_usec;

Convert the time stored by struct timeval into a full microsecond time.

.. code-block:: c

    dis = (float)(time2 - time1) / 1000000 * 34000 / 2;  

The distance is calculated by the time interval and the speed of sound
propagation. The speed of sound in the air: 34000cm/s.
