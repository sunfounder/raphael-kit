Setting Up Without a Screen
------------------------------

If you don't have a monitor, remote login is a viable option.

**Required Components**

* Raspberry Pi
* Power Adapter
* Micro SD card

Using SSH, you can access the Raspberry Pi's Bash shell, which is the default Linux shell. Bash offers a command-line interface for performing various tasks.

For those preferring a graphical user interface (GUI), the remote desktop feature is a convenient alternative for managing files and operations.
