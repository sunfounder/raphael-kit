Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

Before this project, you need to make sure you complete :ref:`3.1.1_py` .

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../img/3.1.18fritzing.png
  :width: 800
  :align: center

**Step 2:** To connect the camera module and complete the configuration, please refer to: :ref:`cpn_camera_module`.

**Step 3:** Go into the Raspberry Pi Desktop. You may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Or access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`remote_desktop`.

**Step 4:** Open a Terminal and get into the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python/

**Step 5:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 4.1.4_AutomaticCaptureCamera.py

After the code runs, PIR will detect the surrounding environment, and if it senses the little squirrel passing by, the camera will take a photo.
The photo interval is 3 seconds, and the total number of photos taken will be displayed through the print window.

There are two potentiometers on the PIR module: one is to adjust sensitivity and the other is to adjust the detection distance. To make the PIR module work better, you You need to turn both of them counterclockwise to the end.

.. note::

   You can also open ``4.1.4_AutomaticCaptureCamera.py`` in the ``~/raphael-kit/python/`` path with a Python IDE, click Run button to run, and stop the code with Stop button.



**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

**Code Explanation**

#. Reads the current user's home directory for saving captured images.

   .. code-block:: python

       user = os.getlogin()
       user_home = os.path.expanduser(f'~{user}')

   This obtains the active user's name and builds a full path to the home directory.

#. Sets up GPIO and configures the PIR motion sensor on ``GPIO17`` as an input.

   .. code-block:: python

       PIR_PIN = 17
       GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
       GPIO.setup(PIR_PIN, GPIO.IN, pull_up_down=GPIO.PUD_DOWN)

   Using a pull-down resistor ensures that the pin reads ``LOW`` when no motion is detected.

#. Initializes the Picamera2 instance and starts the camera.

   .. code-block:: python

       camera = Picamera2()
       camera.start()

   The camera is activated so it can capture images immediately when motion is detected.

#. Detects motion by reading the PIR sensor input state.

   .. code-block:: python

       if GPIO.input(PIR_PIN) == GPIO.HIGH:

   When the PIR senses movement, it outputs a ``HIGH`` signal, triggering the capture process.

#. Captures an image and saves it using a sequential file number.

   .. code-block:: python

       filename = f"{user_home}/capture{i}.jpg"
       camera.capture_file(filename)

   Each detection saves a new image as ``capture1.jpg``, ``capture2.jpg``, and so on.

#. Delays for three seconds after a motion-triggered capture.

   .. code-block:: python

       time.sleep(3)

   This prevents multiple images from being taken too quickly after a single motion event.

#. Prints “waiting” when no motion is detected and checks again after a short delay.

   .. code-block:: python

       else:
           print("waiting")
           time.sleep(0.5)

   This ensures constant monitoring while reducing unnecessary CPU usage.

#. Handles keyboard interruption (Ctrl+C) to exit the program safely.

   .. code-block:: python

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           print("\nKeyboard interrupt received. Exiting program...")

   A clean exit message is printed when the user stops the program manually.

#. Releases camera and GPIO resources before exiting.

   .. code-block:: python

       finally:
           camera.close()
           GPIO.cleanup()

   This ensures the camera shuts down properly and all GPIO pins return to a safe state.
