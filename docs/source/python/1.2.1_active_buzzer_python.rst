1.2.1 Active Buzzer
===================

Introduction
------------

In this project, we will learn how to drive an active buzzer to beep with
a PNP transistor.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Schematic Diagram
-----------------

In this experiment, an active buzzer, a PNP transistor and a 1k resistor
are used between the base of the transistor and GPIO to protect the
transistor. When the GPIO17 of Raspberry Pi output is supplied with low
level (0V) by programming, the transistor will conduct because of
current saturation and the buzzer will make sounds. But when high level
is supplied to the IO of Raspberry Pi, the transistor will be cut off
and the buzzer will not make sounds.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit. (The active buzzer has a white table sticker on the surface and a black back.)

.. image:: ../img/image104.png

**Step 2**: Open the code file.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python

**Step 3**: Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 1.2.1_ActiveBuzzer.py

The code run, the buzzer beeps.

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

    import RPi.GPIO as GPIO
    import time

    # Set GPIO17 as buzzer pin
    BeepPin = 17

    def setup():
        GPIO.setmode(GPIO.BCM)
        GPIO.setup(BeepPin, GPIO.OUT, initial=GPIO.HIGH)

    def main():
        while True:
            # Buzzer on (Beep)
            print ('Buzzer On')
            GPIO.output(BeepPin, GPIO.LOW)
            time.sleep(0.1)
            # Buzzer off
            print ('Buzzer Off')
            GPIO.output(BeepPin, GPIO.HIGH)
            time.sleep(0.1)

    def destroy():
        # Turn off buzzer
        GPIO.output(BeepPin, GPIO.HIGH)
        # Release resource
        GPIO.cleanup()   

    # If run this script directly, do:
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        setup()
        try:
            main()
        # When 'Ctrl+C' is pressed, the program
        # destroy() will be  executed.
        except KeyboardInterrupt:
            destroy()

**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    GPIO.output(BeepPin, GPIO.LOW)

Set the buzzer pin as low level to make the buzzer beep.  

.. code-block:: python

    time.sleep(0.1)

Wait for 0.1 second. Change the switching frequency by 
changing this parameter. 

.. note::
    Not the sound frequency. Active Buzzer cannot change sound frequency.

.. code-block:: python

    GPIO.output(BeepPin, GPIO.HIGH)

Close the buzzer.
