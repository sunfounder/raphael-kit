Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:** Go into the Raspberry Pi Desktop. You may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Or access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`remote_desktop`.

**Step 2:** Open a Terminal and get into the folder of the code.


.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python/

**Step 3:** Run.


.. code-block::

    sudo python3 3.1.2_VideoModule.py

Run the code to start recording. Press ``Ctrl+C`` to end the recording. Name the video ``my_video.h264`` and store it in the ``~`` directory.

.. note::

    You can also open ``3.1.2_PhotographModule.py`` in the ``~/raphael-kit/python/`` path with a Python IDE, click Run button to run, and stop the code with Stop button.

If you want to send photos to your PC, please refer to :ref:`filezilla`.


**Code**

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3

   import time
   from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
   from picamera2.encoders import H264Encoder

   preview_config = camera.preview_configuration

   try:
       # Configure preview size and format

       camera.configure(config)
       camera.start_recording(encoder, output)
       # Record for 10 seconds
       time.sleep(10)
       # Stop the recording
       camera.stop_recording()

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       # Stop the camera preview if a KeyboardInterrupt (e.g., Ctrl+C) occurs
       camera.stop_preview()
       pass


**Code Explanation**

#. Imports necessary libraries and classes. The ``picamera2`` library is used for camera control, ``H264Encoder`` for video encoding, and ``FfmpegOutput`` for defining the video output file.

   .. code-block:: python

       #!/usr/bin/env python3

       import time
       from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
       from picamera2.encoders import H264Encoder
       from picamera2.outputs import FfmpegOutput
       import os

#. Retrieves the current user's login name and the path to their home directory.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Get the current user's login name
       user = os.getlogin()
       # Get the path to the user's home directory
       user_home = os.path.expanduser(f'~{user}')

#. Creates an instance of the ``Picamera2`` class and retrieves the default preview configuration.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Create a Picamera2 instance
       camera = Picamera2()
       # Retrieve the default preview configuration
       preview_config = camera.preview_configuration

#. Sets the size and format of the camera preview. The size is set to 800x600 pixels, and the format is set to ``XRGB8888``.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           # Configure preview size and format
           preview_config.size = (800, 600)
           preview_config.format = 'XRGB8888'
           
#. Starts the camera preview in QTGL mode, a graphical preview mode.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           ...          
             
           # Start the camera preview in QTGL mode
           camera.start_preview(Preview.QTGL)
           
           ...

#. Defines the video configuration with a frame size of 800x600 pixels and a frame rate of 40 frames per second.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           ...
           
           # Define video configuration with size, frame rate, and buffer count
           conf = {'size': (800, 600)}
           controls = {'FrameRate': 40}
           config = camera.create_video_configuration(main=conf, controls=controls, buffer_count=12)
           
           ...

#. Creates a video encoder with a specified bitrate of 10 Mbps, using the H.264 encoding format. Sets up the output file path for the video, saving it as ``my_video.mp4`` in the user's home directory.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           ...

           # Create a video encoder with a specified bitrate
           encoder = H264Encoder(bitrate=10000000)
           # Define output file for the video
           output = FfmpegOutput(f'{user_home}/my_video.mp4')
           
           ...

#. Configures the camera with the defined video settings, starts recording using the specified encoder and output file, records for 10 seconds, and then stops the recording.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           ...

           # Configure and start recording
           camera.configure(config)
           camera.start_recording(encoder, output)
           # Record for 10 seconds
           time.sleep(10)
           # Stop the recording
           camera.stop_recording()

#. This block of code handles a KeyboardInterrupt (such as Ctrl+C) by stopping the camera preview. The ``pass`` statement is used to  handle the exception without doing anything else.

   .. code-block:: python

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           # Stop the camera preview if a KeyboardInterrupt (e.g., Ctrl+C) occurs
           camera.stop_preview()
           pass
