=================

All example programs used in this kit are stored in our official GitHub repository.  
Use the following command to download the complete project to your Raspberry Pi.

Clone the Repository
--------------------

#. Log into your Raspberry Pi and run:

   .. raw:: html
   
       <run></run>
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      cd ~/
      git clone https://github.com/sunfounder/raphael-kit.git --depth 1

#. Enter the project directory:

   .. raw:: html
   
       <run></run>
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      cd ~/raphael-kit/

#. List the files:

   .. raw:: html
   
       <run></run>
   
   .. code-block:: bash
   
      ls

#. You will see a structure similar to this:
