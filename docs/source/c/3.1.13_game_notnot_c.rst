3.1.13 GAME– NotNot
===========================

Introduction
-------------------

In this project, we will make an interesting game device, and we call it “Not Not”.

During the game, the dot matrix will refresh an arrow randomly. What you need to do is to press the button in the opposite direction of the arrow within a limited time. If the time is up, or if the button in the same direction as the arrow is pressed, you are out.

This game can really practice your reverse thinking, and now shall we have a try?

Required Components

Experimental Procedures
---------------------------------

**Step 1**: Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../img/3.1.14game_notnot.png

**Step 2**: Turn on the SPI before starting the experiment, refer to :ref:`spi_configuration` for details.

**Step 3**: Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    cd ~/raphael-kit/c/3.1.13/

**Step 4**: Compile the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    make

**Step 5**: Run the executable file.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block:: 

    sudo ./3.1.13_GAME_NotNot

After the program starts, a left or right arrow will be refreshed at 
random on the dot matrix. What you need to do is to press the button 
in the opposite direction of the arrow, then “√” appears on the dot matrix. If the button in the 
same direction as the arrow is pressed, you are out and the dot matrix 
displays “x”. You can also add 2 new buttons or replace them with 
Joystick keys for up, down, left and right— 4 directions to increase 
the difficulty of the game.

.. note::

    If it does not work after running, or there is an error prompt: \"wiringPi.h: No such file or directory\", please refer to :ref:`install_wiringpi`.

**Code Explanation**

This C program is designed to run on a Raspberry Pi using the WiringPi library. It interfaces with an 8x8 LED matrix display controlled by the MAX7219 driver chip and uses two buttons for user interaction. The program randomly displays a left or right arrow on the LED matrix, and the user must press the corresponding button. It then displays a check mark for a correct response or a cross for an incorrect one.

#. Header Files:

   * ``wiringPi.h``: Provides functions for GPIO control using the WiringPi library.
   * ``wiringPiSPI.h``: Provides functions for SPI communication.
   * ``stdio.h``: Standard input/output functions (``printf``, etc.).
   * ``stdlib.h``: Standard library functions (``rand``, ``srand``, ``exit``).
   * ``time.h``: Functions for manipulating date and time (``time``, ``NULL``).

#. Type Definitions:

   * ``#define uchar unsigned char``: Defines ``uchar`` as an alias for ``unsigned char``.
   * ``#define uint unsigned int``: Defines ``uint`` as an alias for ``unsigned int``.

#. Constants and Macros:

   * ``SPI_CHANNEL``: SPI channel used for communication (0 or 1).
   * ``SPI_SPEED``: SPI communication speed set to 1 MHz.
   * ``AButtonPin``: WiringPi pin number for Button A (GPIO 22).
   * ``BButtonPin``: WiringPi pin number for Button B (GPIO 23).

#. Global Variables:

   * ``int stage = 0;``: Tracks the current stage of the game (displaying arrow or result).

#. Data Arrays:

   * ``uchar arrow[2][8]``: Contains two 8-byte patterns representing right and left arrows for the LED matrix.

     * ``arrow[0]``: Right arrow pattern.
     * ``arrow[1]``: Left arrow pattern.

   * ``uchar check[2][8]``: Contains two 8-byte patterns representing correct (check mark) and incorrect (cross) symbols.

     * ``check[0]``: Correct symbol pattern.
     * ``check[1]``: Incorrect symbol pattern.

#. ``void Delay_xms(uint x)`` Function:

   * Wrapper function for ``delay(x)`` provided by WiringPi.
   * Delays program execution for ``x`` milliseconds.

#. ``void Write_Max7219_byte(uchar DATA)`` Function:

   * Sends a single byte (``DATA``) to the MAX7219 via SPI.
   * Uses ``wiringPiSPIDataRW`` to perform SPI data transfer.
   * ``DATA``: The data byte to send.

#. ``void Write_Max7219(uchar address1, uchar dat1)`` Function:

   * Sends a command and data to the MAX7219.
   * Combines ``address1`` (register address) and ``dat1`` (data) into a buffer and sends via SPI.
   * ``address1``: Address of the MAX7219 register.
   * ``dat1``: Data to write to the register.

#. ``void Init_MAX7219()`` Function:

   * Initializes the MAX7219 display driver with necessary configurations.
   * Configures decode mode, intensity, scan limit, shutdown mode, and display test.
   * Clears any previous data on the display.

#. ``void Init_WiringPi()`` Function:

   * Initializes the WiringPi library and SPI interface.
   * Sets up the button pins as input with pull-up resistors.
   * Checks for successful initialization and exits if failed.

#. ``int get_index()`` Function:

   * Generates a random index (0 or 1) to choose between left and right arrow.
   * Returns: ``0`` or ``1``.

#. ``int get_key(uint num)`` Function:

   * Waits for the user to press a button and determines if the input matches the displayed arrow.
   * Parameters:

     * ``num``: The index of the displayed arrow (0 for right, 1 for left).

   * Returns:

     * ``1`` if the user input is correct.
     * ``0`` if the user input is incorrect.

   * Functionality:

     * Enters an infinite loop checking the state of the buttons.
     * Uses ``digitalRead`` to detect button presses (active LOW).
     * Compares the pressed button with the expected input based on ``num``.

#. ``void display(uint index)`` Function:

   * Displays either an arrow or a result symbol on the LED matrix based on the ``stage``.
   * Parameters:

     * ``index``: Index to select the pattern from ``arrow`` or ``check`` arrays.

   * Functionality:

     * If ``stage == 0``, displays an arrow pattern.
     * If ``stage == 1``, displays a check mark or cross symbol.

#. Main Function:

   * **Initialization:**

     * Seeds the random number generator with ``srand((unsigned)time(NULL))``.
     * Calls ``Init_WiringPi()`` to set up GPIO and SPI.
     * Calls ``Init_MAX7219()`` to initialize the LED matrix display.
     * Introduces a short delay with ``Delay_xms(50)``.
   
   * **Game Loop (``while (1)``):**

     * **Stage 0 (Display Arrow):**

       * Calls ``get_index()`` to randomly select an arrow direction.
       * Calls ``display(direction)`` to show the arrow on the LED matrix.
       * Sets ``stage = 1`` to move to the next stage.

     * **Stage 1 (Get User Input and Display Result):**

       * Calls ``get_key(direction)`` to wait for user input and determine correctness.
       * Calls ``display(key)`` to show the result symbol (check mark or cross).
       * Waits for 1 second using ``Delay_xms(1000)`` to allow the user to see the result.
       * Sets ``stage = 0`` to restart the loop.


**Program Flow Summary:**

1. **Setup:**

   * Initialize WiringPi and SPI.
   * Configure button pins and MAX7219 settings.

   * Randomly select an arrow direction (left or right).
   * Display the corresponding arrow on the LED matrix.

3. **User Interaction:**

   * Wait for the user to press either Button A or Button B.
   * Determine if the pressed button matches the arrow direction.

4. **Display Result:**

   * Show a check mark if the user's input is correct.
   * Show a cross if the user's input is incorrect.
   * Wait for 1 second before the next round.

5. **Repeat:**
