2.2.10 MFRC522 RFID Module
==========================

Introduction
---------------

Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) refers to technologies that use
wireless communication between an object (or tag) and interrogating
device (or reader) to automatically track and identify such objects.

Some of the most common applications for this technology include retail
supply chains, military supply chains, automated payment methods,
baggage tracking and management, document tracking and pharmaceutical
management, to name a few.

In this project, we will use RFID for reading and writing.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

**Step 2:** Install the :ref:`Spidev and MFRC522` libraries.

**Step 3:** Set up SPI (refer to :ref:`SPI Configuration` for more details. If you have
set SPI, skip this step.)


**Step 4:** Go to the folder of the code.

.. code-block::

    cd /home/pi/raphael-kit/python

**Step 5:** After running ``2.2.10_write.py``. You need to write a message first, press ``Enter`` to confirm, then put the card on the MFRC522 module, wait for "Data writing is complete" to appear and take the card away, or rewrite the message to another card and exit by ``Ctrl+C``.

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.2.10_write.py

**Step 6:** Now run ``2.2.10_read.py`` to read the information of the tag or card you have written.

    <run></run>

.. code-block::


    sudo python3 2.2.10_read.py


**Code Explanation**

.. code-block:: python

    reader = SimpleMFRC522()

Instantiate ``SimpleMFRC522()`` class.

.. code-block:: python

    reader.read()

This function is used to read card data. If the reading is successful, id and text will be returned.

.. code-block:: python

    reader.write(text)

This function is used to write information to the card, press ``Enter`` key to finish writing. ``text`` is the information to be written to the card.
