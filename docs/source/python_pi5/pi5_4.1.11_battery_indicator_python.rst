   Depending on your kit version, please identify whether you have **ADC0834** or **MCP3008** and proceed with the matching section.

Introduction
--------------

In this project, we will make a battery indicator device that can
visually display the battery level on the LED Bargraph.

.. warning::

    Do not use battery components that exceed 3.3V to avoid overloading, which may damage the chip or Raspberry Pi.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Experimental Procedures
-------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/4.1.11_battery_indicator_circuit.png

**Step 2:** Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python-pi5

**Step 3:** Run the executable file.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 4.1.11_BatteryIndicator_zero.py

After the program runs, give the 3rd pin of ADC0834 and the GND a
lead-out wire separately and then lead them to the two poles of a
battery separately. You can see the corresponding LED on the LED
Bargraph is lit up to display the power level (measuring range: 0-5V).

.. warning::

    If there is an error prompt  ``RuntimeError: Cannot determine SOC peripheral base address``, please refer to :ref:`faq_soc` 

**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python-pi5``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

**Code Explanation**
---------------------

#. This section imports the necessary libraries. `gpiozero` is used for controlling GPIO pins (specifically LEDs), `spidev` is used to interface with the MCP3008 ADC over SPI, and `time` is used for delays.

   .. code-block:: python

       #!/usr/bin/env python3
       from gpiozero import LED
       import spidev
       import time

#. Defines the GPIO pins to which the LEDs are connected and creates a list of `LED` objects. These are used to represent a bar graph.

   .. code-block:: python

       # List of GPIO pins to which LEDs are connected
       ledPins = [25, 12, 16, 20, 21, 5, 6, 13, 19, 26]
       # Initialize LED objects for each pin in the list
       leds = [LED(pin) for pin in ledPins]

#. Initializes SPI communication for the MCP3008 ADC on SPI bus 0 using CE0. The speed is set to 1 MHz.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Setup SPI for MCP3008
       spi = spidev.SpiDev()
       spi.open(0, 0)              # Open SPI bus 0, device (CE0)
       spi.max_speed_hz = 1000000  # Set SPI speed to 1 MHz

#. Reads a 10-bit analog value (0–1023) from the specified MCP3008 channel. Channel 0 is used by default.

   .. code-block:: python

       def read_adc(channel=0):
           """
           Reads analog value from MCP3008 channel (default CH0).
           Returns a 10-bit value .
           """
           if channel < 0 or channel > 7:
               return -1
           r = spi.xfer2([1, (8 + channel) << 4, 0])
           value = ((r[1] & 0x03) << 8) | r[2]
           return value

#. This function turns on all LEDs first (reset state), then turns off a number of LEDs based on the scaled input value. It creates a reverse bar graph effect (more value = fewer LEDs lit).

   .. code-block:: python

       def LedBarGraph(value):
           # Turn off all LEDs
           for i in range(10):
               leds[i].on()
           # Turn on LEDs up to the specified value
           for i in range(min(value, 10)):
               leds[i].off()

#. Continuously reads the analog value from MCP3008 CH0 and updates the LED bar graph. The analog value is divided by 102.4 to scale it from 0–1023 to a 0–10 LED level.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           # Main loop to continuously update LED bar graph
           while True:
               analogVal = read_adc(0)  # Read from CH0
               LedBarGraph(int(analogVal / 102.4)) 
               time.sleep(0.1)

#. Ensures all LEDs are turned off and SPI is closed when the program is interrupted (e.g., by pressing Ctrl+C).

   .. code-block:: python

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           # Turn off all LEDs when program is interrupted
           for i in range(10):
               leds[i].off()
           spi.close()
