Introduction
-----------------

Here we will make a camera with a shutter, when you press the button, the camera shoots while the LED flashes.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------


**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/4.1.1_camera_circuit.png
  :width: 800
  :align: center

**Step 2:** To connect the camera module and complete the configuration, please refer to: :ref:`cpn_camera_module`.

**Step 3:** Go into the Raspberry Pi Desktop. You may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Or access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`remote_desktop`.

**Step 4:** Open a Terminal and get into the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python-pi5

**Step 5:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 4.1.1_Camera_zero.py

After the code runs, press the button, the Raspberry Pi will flash the LED and take a picture. The photo will be named ``my_photo.jpg`` and stored in the ``~`` directory.

.. note::

    You can also open ``4.1.1_Camera_zero.py`` in the ``~/raphael-kit/python/`` path with a Python IDE, click Run button to run, and stop the code with Stop button.


If you want to download the photo to your PC, please refer to :ref:`filezilla`.

**Code**

.. note::
    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

**Code Explanation**

#. Imports necessary libraries for time handling, camera control, and GPIO component control.

   .. code-block:: python

       #!/usr/bin/env python3
       from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
       from gpiozero import LED, Button
       import time
       import os

#. Retrieves the current user's login name and home directory for saving photos.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Get the current user's login name and home directory
       user = os.getlogin()
       user_home = os.path.expanduser(f'~{user}')

#. Initializes the camera and starts it.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Initialize the camera
       camera = Picamera2()
       camera.start()

#. Declares ``status`` as a global variable and initializes it to ``False``. 

   .. code-block:: python

       # Initialize a variable to track the camera's status
       global status
       status = False

#. Initializes an LED connected to GPIO pin 17 and a button connected to GPIO pin 18.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Set up LED and button with their GPIO pin numbers
       led = LED(17)
       button = Button(18)

#. Defines a function ``takePhotos`` that sets the global variable ``status`` to ``True`` when the button is pressed.

   .. code-block:: python

       def takePhotos(pin):
           """Function to set the camera's status to True when the button is pressed."""
           global status
           status = True

#. Assigns the ``takePhotos`` function to be called when the button is pressed.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           # Assign the function to be called when the button is pressed
           button.when_pressed = takePhotos
           
           ...
           
#. Continuously checks if the ``status`` is ``True``. If so, it blinks the LED five times, captures a photo, and resets ``status``. If not, the LED remains off. There is a 1-second delay between each loop iteration.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:        
           ...
           
           # Main loop
           while True:
               # Check if the button has been pressed
               if status:
                   # Blink the LED five times
                   for i in range(5):
                       led.on()
                       time.sleep(0.1)
                       led.off()
                       time.sleep(0.1)
                   # Capture and save a photo
                   camera.capture_file(f'{user_home}/my_photo.jpg')
                   print('Take a photo!')          
                   # Reset the status
                   status = False
               else:
                   # Turn off the LED if not capturing
                   led.off()
               
               # Wait for a short period before checking the button status again
               time.sleep(1)

#. Catches a KeyboardInterrupt (like Ctrl+C) and stops the camera preview and turns off the LED before exiting.

   .. code-block:: python

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           # Stop the camera and turn off the LED if a KeyboardInterrupt occurs
           camera.stop_preview()
           led.off()
           pass
