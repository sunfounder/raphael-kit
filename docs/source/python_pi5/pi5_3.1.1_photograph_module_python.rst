3.1.1 Photograph Module
==========================

Introduction
-----------------

In this kit, equipped with a camera module, let's try to take a picture with Raspberry Pi.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components. 

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/3.3.1_photograph_list.png
  :width: 800

It's definitely convenient to buy a whole kit, here's the link:

Experimental Procedures
------------------------------

**Step 1:** Go into the Raspberry Pi Desktop. You may need a screen for a better experience, refer to: `Connect your Raspberry Pi <https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/raspberry-pi-setting-up/3>`_. Or access the Raspberry Pi desktop remotely, for a detailed tutorial please refer to :ref:`remote_desktop`.

**Step 2:** Open a Terminal and get into the folder of the code.

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python-pi5

**Step 3:** Run.

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 3.1.1_PhotographModule_zero.py

After the code runs, the camera will take a photo. Now you can see the photo named ``my_photo.jpg`` in the ``~`` directory. 

.. note::

    You can also open ``3.1.1_PhotographModule.py`` in the ``~/raphael-kit/python-pi5/`` path with a Python IDE, click Run button to run, and stop the code with Stop button.


If you want to download the photo to your PC, please refer to :ref:`filezilla`.


**Code**

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3    
   from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
   import os

   # Get the current user's login name
   user = os.getlogin()
   # Get the path to the user's home directory
   user_home = os.path.expanduser(f'~{user}')

   # Create a Picamera2 instance
   camera = Picamera2()
   # Retrieve the default preview configuration
   preview_config = camera.preview_configuration

   try:
       # Set preview size and format
       preview_config.size = (800, 600)
       preview_config.format = 'XRGB8888'  
       # Start the camera preview in QTGL mode
       camera.start_preview(Preview.QTGL)
       # Start the camera
       camera.start()
       # Capture and save a photo to the user's home directory
       camera.capture_file(f'{user_home}/my_photo.jpg')

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       # Stop the camera preview if a KeyboardInterrupt (e.g., Ctrl+C) occurs
       camera.stop_preview()
       pass


**Code Explanation**

#. Imports the ``Picamera2`` and ``Preview`` classes from the picamera2 library, and the ``os`` module for operating system interactions.

   .. code-block:: python

       #!/usr/bin/env python3    
       from picamera2 import Picamera2, Preview
       import os

#. Retrieves the current user's login name and the path to their home directory.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Get the current user's login name
       user = os.getlogin()
       # Get the path to the user's home directory
       user_home = os.path.expanduser(f'~{user}')

#. Creates an instance of the ``Picamera2`` class and retrieves the default preview configuration.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Create a Picamera2 instance
       camera = Picamera2()
       # Retrieve the default preview configuration
       preview_config = camera.preview_configuration

#. Sets the size and format of the camera preview. The size is set to 800x600 pixels, and the format is set to ``XRGB8888``.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           # Set preview size and format
           preview_config.size = (800, 600)
           preview_config.format = 'XRGB8888'

           ...

#. Starts the camera preview in QTGL mode, which is a method for displaying the preview, and then starts the camera itself.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           ...
           
           # Start the camera preview in QTGL mode
           camera.start_preview(Preview.QTGL)
           # Start the camera
           camera.start()

           ...

#. Capture an image from the camera, storing it in ``~/``.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           ...           
           
           # Capture and save a photo to the user's home directory
           camera.capture_file(f'{user_home}/my_photo.jpg')

   .. note::
       You can use ``camera.capture()`` function and ``for`` loop together to achieve continuous shooting. And use the ``delay`` function to adjust the time interval for taking pictures.

       .. code-block:: python

           for i in 5:
               camera.capture(f'{user_home}/my_photo%s.jpg' % i)

#. This block of code handles a KeyboardInterrupt (such as Ctrl+C) by stopping the camera preview. The ``pass`` statement is used to handle the exception without doing anything else.

   .. code-block:: python

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           # Stop the camera preview if a KeyboardInterrupt (e.g., Ctrl+C) occurs
           camera.stop_preview()
           pass
