Experimental Procedures
-------------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/2.2.4_reed_switch_circuit.png
    :width: 700
    :align: center

**Step 2:** Change directory.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python-pi5

**Step 3:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.2.4_ReedSwitch_zero.py

The green LED will light up when the code is run. If a magnet is placed close to the reed switch module, the red LED lights up; take away the magnet and the green LED lights up again.

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python-pi5``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from gpiozero import LED, Button

   # Initialize the reed switch and LEDs using GPIO Zero
   reed_switch = Button(17, pull_up=True)  # Reed switch on GPIO 17, using an internal pull-up resistor
   green_led = LED(27)                     # Green LED connected to GPIO pin 27
   red_led = LED(22)                       # Red LED connected to GPIO pin 22

   def update_leds():
       """
       Update the state of the LEDs based on the reed switch.
       Turns the red LED on and green LED off when the reed switch is pressed, and vice versa.
       """
       if reed_switch.is_pressed:
           green_led.off()          # Turn off the green LED
           red_led.on()             # Turn on the red LED
       else:
           green_led.on()           # Turn on the green LED
           red_led.off()            # Turn off the red LED

   try:
       green_led.on()               # Turn on the green LED at the start
       while True:
           # Set the callback functions for reed switch state changes
           reed_switch.when_pressed = update_leds   # Callback when the switch is pressed
           reed_switch.when_released = update_leds  # Callback when the switch is released

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
       # Clean up resources and exit on Ctrl+C
       green_led.off()
       red_led.off()
       pass

**Code Explanation**

#. This line specifies that the script is to be run using Python 3. It imports ``LED`` and ``Button`` (used for the reed switch) from the gpiozero library.

   .. code-block:: python

       #!/usr/bin/env python3
       from gpiozero import LED, Button

#. Initializes the reed switch on GPIO pin 17 with an internal pull-up resistor. Also initializes two LEDs connected to GPIO pins 27 and 22.

   .. code-block:: python
       
       # Initialize the reed switch and LEDs using GPIO Zero
       reed_switch = Button(17, pull_up=True)  # Reed switch on GPIO 17, using an internal pull-up resistor
       green_led = LED(27)                     # Green LED connected to GPIO pin 27
       red_led = LED(22)                       # Red LED connected to GPIO pin 22

#. Defines the ``update_leds`` function, which updates the LED states based on the reed switch's state. The red LED is turned on and the green LED is turned off when the switch is pressed, and the opposite when released.

   .. code-block:: python

       def update_leds():
           if reed_switch.is_pressed:
               green_led.off()          # Turn off the green LED
               red_led.on()             # Turn on the red LED
           else:
               green_led.on()           # Turn on the green LED
               red_led.off()            # Turn off the red LED

#. Sets the initial state of the green LED to on. The main loop assigns the ``update_leds`` function as callbacks for the ``when_pressed`` and ``when_released`` events of the reed switch. Includes exception handling for KeyboardInterrupt to clean up and exit the program gracefully.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           green_led.on()               # Turn on the green LED at the start
           while True:
               # Set the callback functions for reed switch state changes
               reed_switch.when_pressed = update_leds   # Callback when the switch is pressed
               reed_switch.when_released = update_leds  # Callback when the switch is released

       except KeyboardInterrupt:
           # Clean up resources and exit on Ctrl+C
           green_led.off()
           red_led.off()
           pass
