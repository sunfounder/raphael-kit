2.1.6 Rotary Encoder Module
===========================

Introduction
------------

In this project, you will learn about Rotary Encoder. A rotary encoder is
an electronic switch with a set of regular pulses in strictly timing
sequence. When used with IC, it can achieve increment, decrement, page
turning and other operations such as mouse scrolling, menu selection,
and so on.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Experimental Procedures
-----------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/2.1.6_rotary_encoder_circuit.png

In this example, we can connect the Rotary Encoder pin directly to the
Raspberry Pi using a breadboard and 40-pin Cable, connect the GND of the Rotary 
Encoder to GND, 「+」to 5V, SW to digital GPIO27, DT to digital GPIO18, and CLK to digital GPIO
17.

**Step 2:** Open the code file.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python-pi5

**Step 3:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.1.6_RotaryEncoder_zero.py

You will see the count on the shell. When you turn the rotary encoder clockwise, the count is increased; when turn it counterclockwise, the count is decreased. If you press the switch on the rotary encoder, the readings will return to zero.


.. warning::

    If there is an error prompt  ``RuntimeError: Cannot determine SOC peripheral base address``, please refer to :ref:`faq_soc` 

**Code**

.. note::

   You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python-pi5``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.


.. raw:: html

    <run></run>

.. code-block:: python

   #!/usr/bin/env python3
   from gpiozero import RotaryEncoder, Button
   from time import sleep

   # Initialize the rotary encoder and button
   encoder = RotaryEncoder(a=17, b=18)  # Rotary Encoder connected to GPIO pins 17 (CLK) and 18 (DT)
   button = Button(27)                  # Button connected to GPIO pin 27

   global_counter = 0  # Track the rotary encoder's position

   def rotary_change():
      """ Update the global counter based on the rotary encoder's rotation. """
      global global_counter
      global_counter += encoder.steps  # Adjust counter based on encoder steps
      encoder.steps = 0  # Reset encoder steps after updating counter
      print('Global Counter =', global_counter)  # Display current counter value

   def reset_counter():
      """ Reset the global counter to zero when the button is pressed. """
      global global_counter
      global_counter = 0  # Reset the counter
      print('Counter reset')  # Indicate counter reset

   # Assign the reset_counter function to button press event
   button.when_pressed = reset_counter

   try:
      # Monitor rotary encoder continuously and process changes
      while True:
         rotary_change()  # Handle rotary encoder changes
         sleep(0.1)  # Short delay to reduce CPU load

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
      # Gracefully handle a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
      pass



**Code Analysis**

#. Imports the ``RotaryEncoder`` and ``Button`` classes from the ``gpiozero`` library, and the ``sleep`` function for delays.

   .. code-block:: python

      #!/usr/bin/env python3
      from gpiozero import RotaryEncoder, Button
      from time import sleep

#. Initializes the rotary encoder with GPIO pins 17 and 18, and a button on GPIO pin 27.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Initialize the rotary encoder and button
      encoder = RotaryEncoder(a=17, b=18)  # Rotary Encoder connected to GPIO pins 17 (CLK) and 18 (DT)
      button = Button(27)                  # Button connected to GPIO pin 27

#. Declares a global variable ``global_counter`` to track the position of the rotary encoder.

   .. code-block:: python

      global_counter = 0  # Track the rotary encoder's position

#. Defines a function ``rotary_change`` to update the global counter based on the rotary encoder's rotation.

   .. code-block:: python

      def rotary_change():
         """ Update the global counter based on the rotary encoder's rotation. """
         global global_counter
         global_counter += encoder.steps  # Adjust counter based on encoder steps
         encoder.steps = 0  # Reset encoder steps after updating counter
         print('Global Counter =', global_counter)  # Display current counter value

#. Defines a function ``reset_counter`` to reset the global counter to zero when the button is pressed.

   .. code-block:: python

      def reset_counter():
         """ Reset the global counter to zero when the button is pressed. """
         global global_counter
         global_counter = 0  # Reset the counter
         print('Counter reset')  # Indicate counter reset

#. Assigns the ``reset_counter`` function to be called when the button is pressed.

   .. code-block:: python

      # Assign the reset_counter function to button press event
      button.when_pressed = reset_counter

#. In a continuous loop, the script calls ``rotary_change`` to handle rotary encoder changes and introduces a short delay to reduce CPU load. Uses a try-except block to handle KeyboardInterrupts gracefully.

   .. code-block:: python

      try:
         # Monitor rotary encoder continuously and process changes
         while True:
            rotary_change()  # Handle rotary encoder changes
            sleep(0.1)  # Short delay to reduce CPU load

      except KeyboardInterrupt:
         # Gracefully handle a keyboard interrupt (Ctrl+C)
         pass
