   Depending on your kit version, please identify whether you have **ADC0834** or **MCP3008** and proceed with the matching section.

Introduction
------------

In this project, We're going to learn how joystick works. We manipulate
the Joystick and display the results on the screen.

Required Components
------------------------------

In this project, we need the following components.

Schematic Diagram
------------------

When the data of joystick is read, there are some differents between
axis: data of X and Y axis is analog, which need to use MCP3008 to
convert the analog value to digital value. Data of Z axis is digital, so
you can directly use the GPIO to read, or you can also use ADC to read.

Experimental Procedures
--------------------------

**Step 1:** Build the circuit.

.. image:: ../python_pi5/img/july24_2.1.9_joystick_mcp3008.png

**Step 2:** Set up the SPI interface and install the ``spidev`` library (see :ref:`spi_configuration` for detailed instructions). If you have already completed these steps, you can skip this.

**Step 3:** Go to the folder of the code.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    cd ~/raphael-kit/python-pi5

**Step 4:** Run.

.. raw:: html

   <run></run>

.. code-block::

    sudo python3 2.1.9-2_Joystick_zero.py

After the code runs, turn the Joystick, then the corresponding values of x, y, Btn are displayed on screen.

.. warning::

    If there is an error prompt  ``RuntimeError: Cannot determine SOC peripheral base address``, please refer to :ref:`faq_soc` 

**Code**

.. note::

    You can **Modify/Reset/Copy/Run/Stop** the code below. But before that, you need to go to  source code path like ``raphael-kit/python-pi5``. After modifying the code, you can run it directly to see the effect.

**Code Explanation**

#. This section imports the required libraries:

   * ``gpiozero.Button`` is used to read the digital state of the joystick button (SW pin).
   * ``spidev`` is used for SPI communication with the MCP3008 ADC chip.
   * ``time`` is used for timing delays between readings.

   .. code-block:: python

       #!/usr/bin/env python3
       from gpiozero import Button
       import spidev
       import time

#. Initializes the button connected to GPIO22 (joystick SW pin), and sets up the SPI interface on bus 0, chip select 0 (CE0). The SPI speed is configured to 1 MHz.

   .. code-block:: python

       # Initialize the button connected to GPIO pin 22 (joystick SW pin)
       BtnPin = Button(22)

       # Initialize SPI communication with MCP3008
       spi = spidev.SpiDev()
       spi.open(0, 0)  # Open SPI bus 0, device CE0
       spi.max_speed_hz = 1000000  # Set SPI speed to 1 MHz

#. Defines a function ``read_adc(channel)`` to read the analog value from a specific MCP3008 channel (0–7). It sends three bytes using SPI protocol and returns a 10-bit value (0–1023).

   .. code-block:: python

       def read_adc(channel):
           """
           Reads analog value from the specified MCP3008 channel (0–7)
           :param channel: ADC channel number (0–7)
           :return: 10-bit integer value (0–1023)
           """
           if channel < 0 or channel > 7:
               return -1
           adc = spi.xfer2([1, (8 + channel) << 4, 0])
           value = ((adc[1] & 0x03) << 8) | adc[2]
           return value

#. In the main loop, it reads the analog values from VRX (connected to CH0) and VRY (connected to CH1), as well as the joystick button state. The values are printed to the console every 0.2 seconds. When Ctrl+C is pressed, the SPI interface is cleanly closed.

   .. code-block:: python

       try:
           # Main loop to read and print joystick values and button state
           while True:

               # Wait 0.2 seconds before the next reading

       # Gracefully handle Ctrl+C interruption
